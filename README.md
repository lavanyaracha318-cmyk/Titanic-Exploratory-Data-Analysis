# 🚢 Titanic Survival Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **Titanic Survival Dataset** to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster. Using Python data analysis and visualization libraries, we perform **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization** to extract meaningful insights.

The goal is to explore relationships between features such as **gender, age, passenger class, fare, and embarkation port** with survival outcomes.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

* **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
* **Matplotlib** – Basic data visualization
* **Seaborn** – Advanced and statistical visualizations
* **NumPy** – Numerical computations (if applicable)

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic.

### Key Columns:

* **PassengerId** – Unique ID for each passenger
* **Survived** – Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* **Pclass** – Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
* **Name** – Passenger name
* **Sex** – Gender
* **Age** – Age of passenger
* **SibSp** – Number of siblings/spouses aboard
* **Parch** – Number of parents/children aboard
* **Fare** – Ticket fare
* **Embarked** – Port of embarkation (C, Q, S)

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

The following data cleaning steps were performed:

* Handling **missing values** (Age, Embarked, Cabin)
* Dropping or imputing columns with excessive null values
* Converting categorical variables into appropriate formats
* Checking and removing duplicates (if any)
* Ensuring correct data types for analysis

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand the dataset and identify patterns:

* Survival distribution analysis
* Gender-wise survival comparison
* Survival rate by passenger class
* Age distribution and survival trends
* Fare vs survival relationship
* Embarkation port analysis

Statistical summaries and visual inspections helped uncover key insights.

## 📊 Data Visualization

Data visualizations were created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:

* Bar plots for survival comparison
* Count plots for categorical features
* Histograms for age and fare distribution
* Box plots to identify outliers
* Heatmaps for correlation analysis

These visuals made patterns and trends easier to interpret.

## 📈 Key Insights

Some important findings from the analysis:

* Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males
* Passengers in **1st class** had better survival chances
* Higher ticket fares were associated with higher survival
* Children had a better chance of survival compared to adults
* Embarkation port also influenced survival probability

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates how **data cleaning, EDA, and visualization** can be used to gain insights from real-world datasets. The Titanic dataset provides a strong foundation for practicing data analysis techniques using Python.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Apply machine learning models for survival prediction
* Feature engineering for better insights
* Compare multiple classification algorithms
* Build an interactive dashboard
